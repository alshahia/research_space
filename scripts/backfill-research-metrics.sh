# Append a `## Metrics` block to any share/notes/01_research_*.md missing it.
# Idempotent, append-only. Stdlib only (grep -E + awk; POSIX-reasonable). <10s on <=50 files.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/backfill-research-metrics.sh
# Exit:  0 = no work done (all files already had Metrics, or nothing to scan)
#        1 = at least one file was injected
#
# Discovery: a shell glob on the known naming convention. rg is not required
# (and often absent); grep -E does the content inference below. This is the
# laziest correct file-scan - no external dep, no `find`.
#
# Inferred counts are BEST-EFFORT heuristics. Ceilings are documented per-metric
# in infer_counts(). The backfilled block is stamped as inferred, not authored.
