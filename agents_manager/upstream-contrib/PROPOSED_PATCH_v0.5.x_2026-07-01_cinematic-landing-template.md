     <apply-with-llm> - paste this block into ANY LLM chat (Claude, Codex,
     Gemini, local) to apply the patch mechanically. The LLM should follow the
     numbered steps. Verification at the end is shell-only - no LLM dependency.

<apply-with-llm>

You are an LLM agent applying a vendor-neutral cinematic-landing TASK TEMPLATE to the agents_manager repository. The owner has approved this proposal. Your job is to materialize 22 new files + 2 edits as listed in §3 of this document.

## Apply protocol - 6 steps

1. **Read §3 in full.** Every file the patch creates is a fenced code block under its target absolute path header (format: `### <root-relative-path>`). Do NOT read code blocks under `<apply-with-llm>`, `<review-with-llm>`, or §4–§7 - those are documentation, not file payloads.

2. **Create the directory tree first.**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p templates/cinematic-landing/memory
   mkdir -p templates/cinematic-landing/skeleton
   mkdir -p templates/cinematic-landing/prompts
   mkdir -p templates/cinematic-landing/decisions
   mkdir -p templates/cinematic-landing/assets
   mkdir -p agents_manager/assets/notes
   ```

2.5. **Copy the skeleton from the worked example (Option A - ship demo as-is, 885 lines).**
   ```bash
   cp cinematic-landing-kit-demo/index.html templates/cinematic-landing/skeleton/index.html
   ```
   This is the source-of-truth skeleton for the cinematic-landing template. It was PASS-reviewed as `cinematic-landing-kit-demo/` (T-2026-07-01-002; verdict in `share/reports/04_review_T-2026-07-01-002.md`) and now ships as the template's reference implementation. Do NOT re-write this file - copy it. Source-of-truth stays at `cinematic-landing-kit-demo/index.html`; the template copy is a re-export.

3. **Materialize files in §3 in order.** For each `### <path>` header, write the immediately-following code block to that path. Code blocks may be marked `html`, `css`, `js`, `json`, `yaml`, `md`, `markdown`, or plain - treat the content as the literal file payload. Strip the language tag from the file (only the contents go on disk).

4. **Apply the 2 controller edits.**
   - Edit `agents_manager/SKILL.md` - insert the §3.X "templates paragraph" (find the unique anchor in §3; use the diff provided).
   - Edit `opencode.jsonc` - insert the new `am-assets` agent entry at the bottom of the `"agent"` object (the diff in §3 shows the exact insertion).

5. **Run the verification block.**
   ```bash
   # 1. File-tree verify (compared against MANIFEST.txt in §3.5)
   cat templates/cinematic-landing/assets/MANIFEST.txt | sort > /tmp/expected.txt
   find templates/cinematic-landing/ agents_manager/assets/ -type f | sort > /tmp/actual.txt
   diff -u /tmp/expected.txt /tmp/actual.txt
   # Expected: empty diff.

   # 2. JSON validity check
   python -c "import json; json.load(open('opencode.jsonc'.replace('.jsonc','.json')))" 2>/dev/null || \
     python -c "import json,re; json.load(open(re.sub(r'//.*','',open('opencode.jsonc').read())))"
   # Expected: no exception.

   # 3. Markdown linter spot-check
   for f in templates/cinematic-landing/memory/*.md; do head -1 "$f"; done
   # Expected: each line starts with `# `.
   ```

6. **Report.** Return: paths written + lines per file + the verification diff output + any blockers. If the diff in step 5 is non-empty, surface the missing files to the owner BEFORE advancing.

## What you are NOT doing
- You are NOT editing any file outside the 24 listed in §3.
- You are NOT running `npm install`, `git commit`, or any non-read-only bash.
- You are NOT editing `agents_manager/<role>/SKILL.md` for any role other than master (no role-specific SKILL.md is touched by this patch).
- You are NOT writing the worked-example demo (`cinematic-landing-kit-demo/`). That already exists from T-2026-07-01-002.

<!-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     <review-with-llm> - paste this block into ANY LLM chat for a second-opinion
     review. The LLM should check the patch's correctness without applying it.
     Owner may use this on Claude, Codex, or Gemini - outputs are equivalent.
     ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->

<review-with-llm>

You are an LLM agent reviewing a proposed patch to agents_manager (a multi-agent task orchestration system). The patch adds a vendor-neutral cinematic-landing task template + a 6th specialist `am-assets`. Do NOT apply the patch. Review it.

## Review checklist - 10 questions

1. **Does `am-assets` violate any existing soft-wall rule?** Compare `am-assets`'s CAN/CANNOT list against the existing 5 specialists (master, am-research, am-planning, am-design, am-coder, am-review). Flag any overlap that would create an ambiguity.

2. **Does the 4-branch runtime decision tree** (`templates/cinematic-landing/memory/06-asset-pipeline.md`) **cover the obvious failure modes?** List the obvious failure modes for cinematic landing pages (no assets, wrong-aspect-ratio assets, video without audio rights, etc.) and check whether each maps to a branch + a graceful fallback.

3. **Are the hard rules preserved?** Search the patch for: (a) any `video.currentTime = …` assignment, (b) any `mix-blend-mode` on a GSAP-transformed element, (c) any `<video>` element. The cinematic-landing template MUST inherit the v1 hard rules.

4. **Are the locale + RTL concerns handled?** The cinematic-landing demo ships `lang="en" dir="ltr"` (v1 default is Arabic RTL). The template must NOT lock either direction. Confirm `04-locale-handoff.md` exists and gives the template user a one-flag toggle.

5. **Does the worked-example demo (`cinematic-landing-kit-demo/`)** at the project root **satisfy** the template's `## Acceptance signals`? Walk through the 5 acceptance signals in §7 of this proposal and confirm the demo hits each.

6. **Is the proposal reversible?** Identify the smallest atomic rollback unit (a single file, a single edit). Confirm that reverting it is a no-op for the rest of the controller. If reverting the 6th specialist breaks the templates/, the proposal is NOT atomic.

7. **LLM-actionable:** could Codex (NOT Claude) apply the patch from §3 alone? If the answer requires prose interpretation (not literal code blocks), the patch is not LLM-actionable - flag it.

8. **Documentation debt:** does every file in the template tree have a header comment explaining its purpose + how to edit it? Spot-check 3 random files.

9. **Memory file overlap:** the template's `memory/01–09` files mirror v1's `cinematic-landing-kit-main/memory/01–09`. Is this duplication acceptable, or should the template `import` v1's memory instead? Recommend.

10. **Open question:** the v2 adaptation (T-2026-07-01-001) was paused at the user gate. Does this proposal close that loop, replace it, or leave it untouched? Recommend.

## Output
- PASS / PASS-WITH-NOTES / FAIL verdict.
- For each numbered question: one-line answer + evidence (`path:line` if applicable).
- Top 3 issues if any.
- One-line summary the owner can quote.

# 1. Executive summary

  Two downstream tasks (T-2026-07-01-001 cinematic kit v2 + T-2026-07-01-002 cinematic kit demo) exercised the `agents_manager v0.8.0` pipeline end-to-end on a real cinematic-landing product. The first was paused at the user gate when it surfaced vendor lock-in concerns (Higgsfield-only asset pipeline); the second shipped a single-file demo at 885 lines with **PASS review** and 3 LOW/P4 follow-ups, using only publicly-available Pexels stills. The synthesis surfaced **3 CRITICAL + 4 HIGH** template-level improvements that would let agents_manager **ship cinematic-landing as a reusable task template** rather than rebuild the workflow from scratch each time.

  **Post-apply status (2026-07-03):** all 24 atomic units landed in v0.12.0 with PASS-WITH-NOTES review verdict (1 WARN on `mix-blend-mode` heuristic, 5 LOW review-driven fixes W2-W6, +1 W3 follow-up `04-locale-handoff.md`). v2 axes (a11y + DPR + dark theme) landed in the demo at T-005 + T-004 but not yet folded back into the template. The v2-axis absorption is the focus of T-2026-07-03-003 (in progress as of 2026-07-03).

  The full mechanical patch is in **§3 Applied changes** (exact text to insert into each of 22 new files + 2 edits). Gaps NOT in the patch are in **§4 Workflow gaps surfaced** and **§5 Workflow insights**.

This patch is:
- **100% additive** - no existing behavior changes; all changes are new files, new sections, or new specialist entries.
- **Vendor-neutral by design** - the template ships a 4-branch runtime decision tree that handles "user has Higgsfield" / "user has a video file" / "user has stills" / "user has nothing" identically. No path requires a paid vendor.
- **Multi-LLM ready** - every prompt in `templates/cinematic-landing/prompts/` works for Midjourney, DALL-E, Sora, Runway, Veo, or a local model. The owner is not locked to Claude.
- **Reversible** - every new file lives in `templates/cinematic-landing/` or `agents_manager/assets/`. Both directories can be removed without breaking the existing 5 specialists.
- **Grounded** - the worked example at `cinematic-landing-kit-demo/` (885 lines, PASS review) demonstrates the template producing working output on a real downstream task.

## TL;DR for the owner

> Add `templates/cinematic-landing/` (17 files: memory + skeleton + prompts + decisions + assets) and a 6th specialist `agents_manager/assets/` (5 files: SKILL.md + rules.md + notes + checklist + README) for ~22 new files + 2 controller edits (`SKILL.md` template-paragraph + `opencode.jsonc` am-assets entry). The biggest expected win is **F2 (am-assets specialist)** - it becomes the durable gatekeeper for every future task template, not just this one. The vendor-neutrality (F1 + H1) is what makes the template work whether the user has Higgsfield, Runway, Pexels, or nothing at all. Estimated merge effort: ~30 minutes for a human, ~3 minutes for an LLM applying §3.
  >
  > **Applied 2026-07-03 → v0.12.0. Actual merge effort:** ~30 minutes human + ~15 minutes W2-W6 review-driven fixes + ~10 minutes W3 (`04-locale-handoff.md`) follow-up. The biggest expected win (F2 am-assets specialist) was realized; am-assets now sits at Phase 3a in the pipeline. v2 axes (a11y + DPR + dark theme) remain source-only at this checkpoint - the demo at T-005 + T-004 is fully shipped, template absorption is tracked separately as T-2026-07-03-003 (in progress; expected: 4 new memory files 11/12/13/14 + skeleton extension ~271 LOC + this proposal §F sync).

# 2. Why this template (T-2026-07-01-001 + T-2026-07-01-002 evidence)

This is the data the proposal is grounded in. Real numbers, all from the two upstream tasks.

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Phases dispatched (T-002) | 3 (research → plan → build → review, 4 total stages) | Small project; demo shipped in one cycle |
| Phases paused (T-001) | 1 of 4 | v2 paused at user gate when vendor-lock question surfaced |
| Fix-loops used (T-002) | 0 | Review PASS on first dispatch |
  | Lines of demo (T-002) | 885 (proposal-time) → 896 (post-apply in v0.12.0 template skeleton after W4 skip-link + W5 mid-session reduce listener added) → 1133 (post-v2-axis absorption in T-2026-07-03-003) | Single HTML file, ~52 KB at proposal time → ~79 KB after W4+W5 → ~82 KB after v2-axis extension (FOUC + dark cascade + film a11y + keyboard nav + theme controller) |
| Brand-voice words avoided | 4 of 4 (luxurious / premium / artisanal / curated) | Coder grep-verified; reviewer re-verified |
| Hard-rule violations | 0 | All 5 v1 hard rules preserved in demo |
| Pexels IDs HEAD-200 | 14 of 15 | One 404 found, replaced; reviewer re-verified all 14 |
| Phase 3a dispatch points (existing 5 specialists) | none - asset decisions made by master | F2 (am-assets) closes this gap |
| Vendor-platform assumptions in the demo | 1 (Higgsfield frame-extraction) | F1 + H1 close this gap |
| Multi-LLM prompt coverage in v1 | 0 prompts - vendor-specific | H2 (multi-LLM prompts) closes this gap |
| Worked example shipped alongside template | n/a - T-002 is the example | H4 (demo-as-example) ships with the patch |

**Inference:** the biggest gaps in the cinematic-landing workflow are (1) no specialist to gate asset decisions at build time, (2) no vendor-neutrality baked into the run-time, (3) no multi-LLM prompts so the user can supply assets with their favorite tools. All three are mechanical fixes in this patch.

# Cinematic Landing - Task Template

A vendor-neutral, multi-LLM-aware task template for building a cinematic, scroll-driven
single-page product site. Works whether the user has:

- A video pipeline (Higgsfield / Runway / Replicate) → Branch A
- A standalone video file → Branch B
- Public-domain or self-supplied stills (Pexels / Unsplash / Midjourney) → Branch C
- Nothing at all → Branch D (concrete ask-list generated; graceful fallback shipped)

The template ships with:

- **`memory/`** - 14 memory files governing how am-research, am-planning, am-assets,
  am-coder, and am-review approach a cinematic-landing task. Each file is a prose
  contract, not a hard rule - adapt per project.
- **`skeleton/`** - a reference implementation (~1100 lines, grown post-merge; see
  `share/templates/cinematic-landing-fixes.md` Fix #6) showing the engine wired up
  in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS + Lenis + GSAP + ScrollTrigger. Edit, don't fork.
- **`prompts/`** - copy-paste prompts for Midjourney, DALL-E, Sora, Runway, Veo,
  and a generic image/video gen prompt. Owner picks the LLM they trust.
- **`decisions/`** - decision-log template that am-assets appends to at build time.
- **`assets/`** - `manifest.schema.json` (JSON Schema 2020-12) for the asset manifest
  `am-assets` produces at Branch decision time, plus this MANIFEST.txt.

## How to discover this template

A specialist finds this template by grepping for:
- `data-section="hero"` (matches the skeleton)
- `.fallback-host.is-missing` (matches the hard rules)
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` (matches the a11y floor)

If a user task includes any of these phrases, this template applies:
- "cinematic landing", "scroll-driven hero", "scrolltelling"
- "single-page product site with frame sequence"
- "apothecary / fragrance / candle site with cutout hero"
- "Lenis + GSAP single ticker"

If unsure, `am-planning` reads `memory/01-builder-flow.md` and decides.

## How to apply

1. **`am-assets` reads `memory/06-asset-pipeline.md`** and runs the 4-branch decision tree
   against the user's asset reality. Produces `assets/MANIFEST.json` per branch.
2. **`am-planning` reads `memory/01-builder-flow.md` and `memory/02-scroll-film-canvas.md`**,
   writes the plan referencing this template's skeleton + memory files.
3. **`am-coder` reads `skeleton/index.html`** as the structural baseline, customizes
   for the user's brand + asset manifest, preserves all 5 hard rules.
4. **`am-review` reads `agents_manager/assets/resources/landing-review-checklist.md`** before
   review - it codifies the 5 hard rules + 4-branch runtime verification.

## What this template is NOT

- **NOT** a no-code platform. The user (or am-coder) still writes HTML/CSS/JS.
- **NOT** a hosted template engine. It's a folder of memory + skeleton + prompts the
  agents_manager pipeline reads.
- **NOT** vendor-locked. See Branch A–D above.
- **NOT** opinionated about locale. Default is LTR English; flip via `04-locale-handoff.md`.

### `templates/cinematic-landing/memory/01-builder-flow.md`

````markdown
# 01 · Builder flow - what to build, in what order

The cinematic-landing build proceeds in 6 stages. Each stage produces one decision +
one artifact. The skeleton in `skeleton/index.html` is the running target; stages
2–5 are net-additive customizations on top of it.

## Stage 1 - Brand voice

am-design (or master, if am-design is not invoked) reads `02_brand/voice-and-tone.md`
analogues in the project's design subtree. For a cinematic-landing task, the brand voice
governs: hero copy, ritual copy, CTA frames, journal blurbs.

If no project voice doc exists, fall back to: short, sensory, second-person, no marketing
adjectives (no "luxurious", "premium", "artisanal (overused)", "curated (overused)").

## Stage 2 - Asset manifest

`am-assets` runs the 4-branch decision tree (`memory/06-asset-pipeline.md`) and writes
`assets/MANIFEST.json` per branch. This is the source of truth for every image / video URL
the build uses.

## Stage 3 - Section structure

Six sections. Order is locked:

1. `<header>` - sticky, hide on scroll-down / show on scroll-up.
2. `<section data-section="hero">` - cutout + aura + motes + pointer tilt + sheen.
3. `<section data-section="film">` - scroll-driven crossfade (Branch C) or frame-sequence
   scrub (Branch A) or `<video>` ambient (Branch B) or graceful fallback (Branch D).
4. `<section data-section="reveal">` - single still + scrollcue.
5. <section data-section="ritual">` - two-up lifestyle stills + copy blocks.
6. `<section data-section="cta">` - still backdrop + 3-frame click-advance (any branch).
7. `<section data-section="editions">` - 3-card grid (or N-card for other counts).
8. `<footer>` - placeholder; copyright stays fictitious in demos.

## Stage 4 - Lenis + GSAP single ticker

One `requestAnimationFrame` loop. GSAP ticker advances Lenis. ScrollTrigger watches
scroll progress. No duplicate tickers. Per `memory/03-scroll-ticker.md`.

## Stage 5 - Ambient color tween

Each section gets a `data-ambient="<hex>"` attribute. A single `gsap.ticker.add` callback
reads the current section and tweens `#ambient`'s `background-color` to that section's
hex value. Per `memory/05-theming.md`.

## Stage 6 - Reduced-motion short-circuit

One CSS `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block + one JS `matchMedia` listener
that gates: Lenis init, film crossfade, ken-burns pan, motes, sheen, scrollcue, hero
entrance, hero parallax, reveals, CTA click handler.

## Order matters

Stages 1–2 may run in parallel. Stages 3–6 are sequential; each consumes the previous
stage's output. The plan self-score must hit testability=5 for at least Stages 3 + 6.

### `templates/cinematic-landing/memory/02-scroll-film-canvas.md`

````markdown
# 02 · Scroll-driven film section - 3 implementation paths

The "film" section is the cinematic-landing template's center-of-gravity moment. Three
implementation paths exist; pick per `memory/06-asset-pipeline.md`.

## Path A - Canvas frame-sequence scrub (Higgsfield-class pipelines)

A `<canvas>` is scrubbed via a `requestAnimationFrame` loop that draws the current frame
based on `scrollTrigger.progress * (frames.length - 1)`. Frames are pre-extracted PNGs
served from the user's CDN or local `assets/frames/`.

**Hard rule:** NEVER scrub `video.currentTime`. The canvas approach does NOT use `<video>`.

**When:** Branch A in the runtime decision tree.

## Path B - `<video>` ambient playback (standalone video files)

A single `<video autoplay muted loop playsinline>` plays continuously. Scroll position
does NOT affect playback time. A second JS layer adds a CSS parallax transform on the
container to create the illusion of scroll-driven motion.

**Hard rule:** NEVER attach `scrollTrigger` to `video.currentTime`. The illusion comes
from CSS transforms, not from video scrubbing.

**When:** Branch B in the runtime decision tree.

## Path C - Still-image crossfade (any pipeline)

5–6 stills stacked at `position: absolute` in a pinned ScrollTrigger section. A single
GSAP ticker callback reads `scrollTrigger.progress`, computes
`Math.round(progress * (N-1))`, and tweens the matching frame's `opacity` to 1 while
neighbors tween to 0. Mathematically equivalent for the viewer.

**Hard rule:** NEVER animate the `<img>` `src` attribute. Animate `opacity` only.

**When:** Branch C in the runtime decision tree (also the demo's actual implementation).

## Path D - Graceful fallback (nothing)

`.fallback-host.is-missing` renders a tasteful gradient. The user knows to supply assets
via `assets/MANIFEST.json` (Branch D's manifest asks for them concretely).

## Hard rules (apply to all paths)

1. **NEVER** `video.currentTime = …` (where `<video>` is used at all).
2. **NEVER** apply `mix-blend-mode` to any element GSAP is transforming.
3. **ALWAYS** use cutouts over blend tricks for the hero aura.
4. **ALWAYS** preserve `.fallback-host.is-missing` so any 404 renders a gradient.
5. **ALWAYS** honor `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` - skip the Lenis init, skip the
   crossfade / scrub, jump straight to "scroll to read" mode.

## Why three paths

The cinematic-landing template MUST work whether the user has:
- An expensive frame-extraction pipeline (Branch A)
- A simple mp4 file (Branch B)
- Free stock stills (Branch C)
- Nothing yet (Branch D)

The user picks their path at build time. `am-assets` records the choice in
`assets/MANIFEST.json`.

### `templates/cinematic-landing/memory/03-scroll-ticker.md`

````markdown
# 03 · Single ticker - Lenis + GSAP co-driven

The cinematic-landing template uses ONE `requestAnimationFrame` loop, owned by GSAP. Lenis
attaches as the scroll source. ScrollTrigger watches ScrollTrigger-internal progress
events.

## The pattern (vanilla JS, ~40 lines)

```js
import Lenis from '@studio-freight/lenis';
import { gsap } from 'gsap';
import { ScrollTrigger } from 'gsap/ScrollTrigger';

gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);

const lenis = new Lenis({
  duration: 1.2,
  easing: (t) => Math.min(1, 1.001 - Math.pow(2, -10 * t)),
  smoothWheel: true,
});

gsap.ticker.add((time) => {
  lenis.raf(time * 1000);
});
gsap.ticker.lagSmoothing(0);

// Lenis drives ScrollTrigger
lenis.on('scroll', ScrollTrigger.update);
```

## Why one ticker

Multiple `requestAnimationFrame` loops fight for frame budget. GSAP's ticker is the single
point of coordination. Lenis's RAF is replaced by `gsap.ticker.add(lenis.raf)`.

## Hard rule

- **NEVER** add a separate `requestAnimationFrame` for hero parallax, sheen animation, or
  CTA timer. All motion goes through the GSAP ticker.
- **NEVER** use `setInterval` for scroll-driven motion. Scroll drives the ticker.
- **NEVER** call `lenis.raf()` outside the GSAP ticker callback.

## Reduced-motion

If `(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` matches, do NOT init Lenis. Native scroll takes over.
The site remains usable - just less cinematic.

````markdown
# 04 · Cinematic hero - cutout + aura + motes + pointer tilt + sheen

The hero is the cinematic-landing template's most opinionated section. Five layered
elements work together to produce the "ritual moment" effect.

## Layer 1 - Foreground cutout

A transparent PNG of the product (or a CSS-masked image of the product). Receives:
- Pointer-tilt: `transform: rotateX(...) rotateY(...)` driven by mousemove.
- Entrance: GSAP tween from `opacity: 0; scale: 0.92; translateY(40px)` on load.
- Parallax: subtle `translateY` driven by scroll position (≤8px range).

## Layer 2 - Aura

The same (or different) image, heavily blurred (`filter: blur(40px) saturate(0.85)`),
positioned behind the cutout. Provides the warm-halo glow.

**Hard rule:** Use a SECOND image for the aura, NOT the same image with `filter: blur()`
applied. Two images means the cutout can parallax without the aura also moving - better
separation. If only one image is available, use a `<canvas>` blur on a copy.

## Layer 3 - Motes

20–40 SVG `<circle>` particles with `cx`, `cy`, `r`, and per-particle `animation-delay`.
Slow upward drift via `@keyframes`. Opacity 0.05–0.20. Pointer-driven parallax
subtly shifts the mote field.

## Layer 4 - Pointer tilt

`mousemove` listener captures `clientX` and `clientY`, computes normalized
`(-0.5 .. +0.5)`, applies `rotateX(ny * 8deg) rotateY(nx * -8deg)` to the cutout.
`requestAnimationFrame`-throttled. Reduced-motion → disabled.

## Layer 5 - Masked sheen

A diagonal-gradient overlay (`linear-gradient(115deg, transparent 40%, white 50%, transparent 60%)`)
animated across the cutout via `background-position` keyframes. Period 6–8s. Reduced-motion
→ disabled.

## Z-stack

```
z=0   #ambient
z=1   #glow
z=2   #vignette
z=3   .aura (blurred backdrop)
z=4   .motes
z=5   .cutout (foreground)
z=6   .sheen (above cutout)
z=60  #grain (always-on grain texture)
```

## Hard rules

- **NEVER** `mix-blend-mode` on any element with a GSAP transform.
- **NEVER** mask the cutout with a gradient - use the actual transparent PNG.
- **NEVER** animate `width` / `height` for the pointer tilt - animate `transform` only
  (GPU-accelerated, no layout thrash).
- **ALWAYS** disable pointer tilt + sheen + motes drift under `prefers-reduced-motion`.

# 05 · Theming - CSS custom properties + per-section ambient tween

The cinematic-landing template uses CSS custom properties (`:root` + per-section
overrides) for theming. Two layers:

## Layer 1 - Base tokens (`:root`)

```css
:root {
  /* Paper / surface */
  --paper:   #FBF6EE;
  --mist:    #F6F0E4;
  --cream:   #F1E9D7;
  --sand:    #E8DBC1;

  /* Ink (text) */
  --ink:        #241812;
  --ink-soft:   #6E5C4B;
  --ink-faint:  #7A6855;   /* v1 was #9A8975; raised for WCAG AA */

  /* Brand accent */
  --gold:        #B07A2E;
  --gold-deep:   #8B5E22;
  --gold-bright: #CC9A4A;
  --accent:      #9C5026;

  /* Lines */
  --line:      rgba(58, 33, 20, 0.16);
  --line-soft: rgba(58, 33, 20, 0.09);

  /* Motion */
  --ambient: var(--paper);
  --maxw:    1280px;
  --ease:    cubic-bezier(.22, .61, .36, 1);
}
```

## Layer 2 - Per-section ambient override

Every section gets `data-ambient="<hex>"`. A single GSAP ticker callback reads the
currently-visible section and tweens `#ambient`'s `background-color` to that hex.

```js
gsap.ticker.add(() => {
  const sections = document.querySelectorAll('[data-section]');
  const scrollY = window.scrollY;
  for (const s of sections) {
    const rect = s.getBoundingClientRect();
    if (rect.top < window.innerHeight / 2 && rect.bottom > window.innerHeight / 2) {
      const target = s.dataset.ambient || getComputedStyle(s).backgroundColor;
      gsap.to('#ambient', { backgroundColor: target, duration: 0.8, ease: 'power2.out', overwrite: 'auto' });
      break;
    }
  }
});
```

## Dark mode (opt-in)

For projects that want a dark variant, add:

```css
[data-theme="dark"] {
  --paper:     #0F0B08;
  --ink:       #F1E9D7;
  --ink-soft:  #B8A687;
  --ink-faint: #8E7B5F;
  /* … invert line + accent with appropriate adjustments */
}
```

Toggle via `<html data-theme="dark">`. JS reads `localStorage.getItem('theme')` and applies.

## Hard rules

- **ALWAYS** reference colors as tokens (`var(--ink)`), never inline hex.
- **NEVER** introduce a color not in the palette (per `agents_manager/design/resources/brand-template.md`).
- **ALWAYS** verify `--ink-faint` against `--paper` for 4.5:1 contrast (WCAG AA body text).
  The v1 default of `#9A8975` on `#FBF6EE` fails - use `#7A6855` instead.
- **NEVER** apply `data-theme` to a non-`<html>` element. Theme is document-wide.

### `templates/cinematic-landing/memory/06-asset-pipeline.md`

````markdown
# 06 · Asset pipeline - 4-branch runtime decision tree

The cinematic-landing template MUST work whether the user has any combination of:
- A video pipeline (Higgsfield / Runway / Replicate / Sora)
- A standalone video file (mp4 / webm / mov)
- Public-domain or self-supplied stills (Pexels / Unsplash / Midjourney / DALL-E)
- Nothing at all

`am-assets` runs this decision tree at build time and records the branch in
`assets/MANIFEST.json`. The branch determines which implementation path the build takes
for each section.

## The 4 branches

```
                ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
                │ User has assets?                         │
                └──────────────────────────────────────────┘

   memory/02         memory/02         memory/02         memory/02
```

## Branch A - Video pipeline (Higgsfield / Runway / Replicate)

The user has access to a frame-extraction pipeline that produces 60–240 PNG frames from a
slow-mo video. Branch A applies when:
- The user mentions Higgsfield / Runway / Replicate by name, OR
- The user provides an mp4 + an API key for a frame-extraction service, OR
- The user already has extracted frames in a folder.

**Implementation path:** Path A in `memory/02-scroll-film-canvas.md` - canvas frame-sequence
scrub. The hero cutout, if supplied as a transparent PNG from the same pipeline, uses it
directly; otherwise falls back to a CSS-masked image.

**Manifest schema:** `assets/MANIFEST.json` populated with `frames[]`, `hero_cutout.png`,
`aura_source.png`, plus `pipeline: "higgsfield" | "runway" | "replicate"`.

## Branch B - Standalone video file

The user has an mp4/webm/mov but no extraction pipeline. Branch B applies when:
- The user provides a single video URL or local file, OR
- The user says "I have a clip but no frames", OR
- The manifest `video_url` field is set.

**Implementation path:** Path B in `memory/02-scroll-film-canvas.md` - `<video>` ambient
playback + CSS parallax illusion.

**Manifest schema:** `assets/MANIFEST.json` populated with `video_url`, `video_poster`,
`video_duration`, `parallax_intensity` (0..1).

**Hard rule:** Do NOT scrub `video.currentTime` with scroll. Use CSS transforms only.

## Branch C - Stills only (Pexels / Unsplash / Midjourney / DALL-E)

The user has 1+ still images but no video. Branch C applies when:
- The user supplies image URLs or local files, OR
- The user says "I have product photos but no video".

**Implementation path:** Path C in `memory/02-scroll-film-canvas.md` - scroll-driven
crossfade of 5–6 stills.

**Manifest schema:** `assets/MANIFEST.json` populated with `still_urls[]` (5–6 entries,
each with `subject`, `aspect_ratio`, `source_license`), plus a hero `cutout_subject` and
`aura_subject`.

**Asset source hint:** if the user has none, point them at `prompts/image-gen.md` for a
Midjourney / DALL-E prompt they can paste.

## Branch D - Nothing yet

The user has no assets. Branch D applies when:
- The user says "I'll add images later" / "I don't have anything yet", OR
- The manifest is empty after `am-assets` runs the discovery ask.

**Implementation path:** Path D in `memory/02-scroll-film-canvas.md` - graceful fallback.
`.fallback-host.is-missing` renders a tasteful gradient on every section. The build ships
without blocking on missing assets.

**Manifest schema:** `assets/MANIFEST.json` populated with `branch: "D"`,
`ask_list: ["..."]`, plus a per-section "to supply" list. The user fills in over time.

**Concrete ask-list generator:** Branch D triggers `prompts/image-gen.md` +
`prompts/video-gen.md` to produce a copy-paste ask list the user can hand to themselves
or to a designer:

```
To complete this build, supply:
  1 hero transparent PNG (3000×4000, no background)
  6 lifestyle stills (1800×1200, vertical 3:2)
  3 product stills (1200×1500, square)
  OR 1 hero mp4 (1920×1080, slow-mo 60fps, ≤30s)
  OR 1 still sequence (5–6 frames, 2400×1600, sequential moments)

Recommended tools: Midjourney v6, DALL-E 3, Sora, Runway Gen-3, Veo 2.
See `prompts/image-gen.md` for ready-to-paste prompts.
```

## Why 4 branches

Cinematic-landing is a popular template. Users will arrive with every possible asset
state. A template that hard-codes "Branch C only" fails on the most common case (user has
nothing yet). A template that hard-codes "Branch A only" excludes the 90% who don't have
Higgsfield. The 4-branch tree handles every input identically.

## The runtime decision (in `am-assets`'s dispatcher)

```js
function pickBranch(manifest) {
  if (manifest.frames?.length || manifest.pipeline) return 'A';
  if (manifest.video_url) return 'B';
  if (manifest.still_urls?.length) return 'C';
  return 'D';
}
```

The branch is recorded in `manifest.branch` and consumed by `am-coder` when reading the
implementation path from `memory/02-scroll-film-canvas.md`.

### `templates/cinematic-landing/memory/07-reduced-motion.md`

````markdown
# 07 · Reduced-motion - the a11y floor

The cinematic-landing template honors `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` at three layers:
CSS, JS, and markup.

## Layer 1 - CSS media query

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  /* Disable all CSS-driven motion */
  *, *::before, *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    scroll-behavior: auto !important;
  }
  /* Hide decorative-only layers */
  .motes, .sheen, #grain { display: none; }
  /* Make scrollcues static */
  .scrollcue::after { content: "↓" }
}
```

## Layer 2 - JS matchMedia listener

```js
const motionQuery = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)');
const reducedMotion = motionQuery.matches;

if (!reducedMotion) {
  // Init Lenis
  // Init GSAP ScrollTrigger
  // Init pointer tilt
  // Init sheen animation
  // Init CTA click handler
}

// Listen for mid-session change (user toggles system setting)
motionQuery.addEventListener('change', (e) => {
  if (e.matches) {
    // Teardown: stop Lenis, kill ScrollTriggers, remove tilt
    // Reset to native scroll
  } else {
    // Re-init the above
    location.reload(); // simplest correct behavior
  }
});
```

## Layer 3 - Markup

- `<html lang="en" dir="ltr">` (default; flips via `04-locale-handoff.md`)
- `<canvas role="img" aria-label="...">` (when canvas is used in Branch A)
- Hidden `<ol>` transcript synced to scrub (Branch A only; provides alt-text equivalent
  for screen readers)
- Skip-link `<a href="#main" class="skip-link">Skip to content</a>` as the first focusable
  element

## Hard rules

- **ALWAYS** include the CSS media query AND the JS matchMedia listener. CSS-only is
  insufficient because GSAP-driven motion is JS.
- **ALWAYS** include the mid-session `change` listener. Users toggle this setting live.
- **NEVER** make the reduced-motion path slower than the regular path. If anything, it
  should be faster (no animation overhead).

## Why this matters

The cinematic-landing aesthetic is heavy on motion. Without `prefers-reduced-motion`,
users with vestibular disorders, ADHD, or migraine triggers cannot use the site. The
a11y floor is non-negotiable per the v1 hard rules.
````

### `templates/cinematic-landing/memory/08-cta-frames.md`

````markdown
# 08 · CTA frames - 3-frame click-advance pattern

The cinematic-landing template's CTA section uses a 3-frame click-advance pattern instead
of autoplay. Three reasons:

1. **No autoplay assumption.** Users with screen readers, low-bandwidth, or reduced-motion
   settings don't get surprised by animation.
2. **Each click is a ritual moment.** The CTA's job is to invite action; manual advance
   reinforces intent.
3. **Vendor-neutral.** No `<video>` dependency; works on Branch A, B, C, D identically.

## The 3 frames (copy skeleton)

```html
<section data-section="cta">
  <div class="cta-backdrop"><!-- blurred still or gradient --></div>
  <div class="cta-stage" data-stage="0">
    <h2 class="cta-copy">Discover the ritual</h2>
    <button class="cta-advance">→</button>
  </div>
  <div class="cta-stage" data-stage="1" hidden>
    <h2 class="cta-copy">Read the journal</h2>
    <button class="cta-advance">→</button>
  </div>
  <div class="cta-stage" data-stage="2" hidden>
    <h2 class="cta-copy">Shop the editions</h2>
    <button class="cta-advance">→</button>
  </div>
</section>
```

## The JS (~12 lines)

```js
let ctaStage = 0;
const stages = document.querySelectorAll('.cta-stage');
document.querySelector('.cta-advance')?.addEventListener('click', () => {
  stages[ctaStage].hidden = true;
  ctaStage = (ctaStage + 1) % stages.length;
  stages[ctaStage].hidden = false;
});
// Also advance on ArrowRight / Space when CTA is in viewport
document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
  if ((e.key === 'ArrowRight' || e.key === ' ') && /* CTA in viewport */) {
    /* same advance logic */
  }
});
```

## Why not video

The v1 skeleton's CTA played a video playlist advanced by `ended` events. This required
a video asset (Branch A or B). The 3-frame pattern works on any branch. The user can
still attach a video if they want; the pattern is a fallback that doesn't depend on one.

## Hard rules

- **ALWAYS** make the advance trigger keyboard-accessible (Tab + Enter/Space).
- **ALWAYS** respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` - disable the slow ken-burns pan
  on the backdrop; keep the click-advance (it's not motion, it's interaction).
- **NEVER** auto-advance on a timer. Manual only.

### `templates/cinematic-landing/memory/09-quality-bar.md`

````markdown
# 09 · Quality bar - what `am-review` checks for

The cinematic-landing template's quality bar is codified in
`agents_manager/assets/resources/landing-review-checklist.md`. The 7 dimensions
`am-review` evaluates:

## 1. Hard rules (P0 - fail-the-build)

- No `video.currentTime = …` assignment
- No `<video>` tag unless Branch B
- No `mix-blend-mode` on GSAP-transformed elements
- `.fallback-host.is-missing` present and wired
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` honored (CSS + JS)

## 2. Asset integrity (P1)

- All asset URLs HEAD-200
- `assets/MANIFEST.json` matches the URLs in the HTML
- Image `srcset` / `sizes` for DPR ladder (or document why not)

## 3. Structure & DNA (P1)

- All 8 sections present (`<header>`, hero, film, reveal, ritual, cta, editions, footer)
- Header hide/show on scroll direction
- Lenis + GSAP single ticker (no duplicate RAFs)
- Per-section `data-ambient` attribute

## 4. Brand voice (P2)

- No marketing clichés (luxurious / premium / artisanal (overused) / curated (overused))
- Copy is sensory, second-person, concrete
- Tagline + brand label consistent across hero, header, footer

## 5. Documented deviations (P3)

- Branch C crossfade implemented as specified (Path C in memory/02)
- Branch B video implemented as specified (Path B in memory/02)
- 3-frame CTA click-advance implemented as specified (memory/08)
- All deviations read from `assets/MANIFEST.json` correctly

## 6. Code quality (P4)

- No console errors at parse time
- No dead code, no commented-out blocks
- No `eval`, no `Function()`, no unsafe patterns
- CSS specificity not exploding (no `!important` chains)

## 7. Locale (P1)

- `lang` and `dir` attributes set per `04-locale-handoff.md`
- No hardcoded English-only strings (use `data-i18n` attributes for any future i18n)
- RTL layout works when `dir="rtl"`

## Verdict format

`am-review` writes one of:
- **PASS** - all P0 + P1 pass, P3 deviations implemented as specified
- **PASS-WITH-NOTES** - all P0 + P1 pass, P2/P3/P4 have minor non-blocking issues
- **FAIL** - any P0 fails, P1 has uncovered 404, P3 deviations silently dropped
````

### `templates/cinematic-landing/skeleton/index.html`

**Source-of-truth (Option A - ship demo as-is):**

```bash
cp cinematic-landing-kit-demo/index.html templates/cinematic-landing/skeleton/index.html
```

The skeleton is the **cinematic-landing-kit-demo** (885 lines, PASS review verdict from `share/reports/04_review_T-2026-07-01-002.md`). Source-of-truth remains `cinematic-landing-kit-demo/index.html`; the template copy is a re-export. Future updates to the demo propagate to the skeleton via `cp` (or a symbolic link - owner's preference).

The LLM applying this patch executes Step 2.5 of the `<apply-with-llm>` block (top of this file) to perform the copy. Verification via `find templates/cinematic-landing/ -name "index.html" -exec wc -l {} \;` should report 885 lines (matches demo).

**Skeleton spec (unchanged from T-2026-07-01-002):**
- Single HTML file
- Inline CSS (~250 lines) + inline JS (~300 lines)
- Uses CDN-hosted Lenis + GSAP + ScrollTrigger (no build step)
- Branch C implementation by default (works without video pipeline)
- Branches A / B / D selectable via `assets/MANIFEST.json` + a one-flag `<html data-branch="A|B|C|D">` switch
- All 5 hard rules preserved
- `.fallback-host.is-missing` wired
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` honored
- v1 design DNA: light gallery theme, scroll-driven cinematic hero with cutout + aura + motes, pointer tilt + sheen, ambient color tween per section

# Image generation prompts

Copy-paste these into Midjourney, DALL-E 3, Sora (image mode), Stable Diffusion XL,
or any compatible image generator. Each prompt is structured to produce an image
that matches the cinematic-landing template's hero / film / ritual slots.

## Hero cutout

```
A single object on a transparent background, lit from above by warm golden light.
Soft shadow beneath. Product-photography style, NOT illustrated.
Aspect ratio: 3:4 (portrait).
Style: editorial, calm, ritual-moment.
Avoid: text, logos, multiple objects, busy backgrounds.
[USER: replace "object" with their product - e.g. "a small ceramic candle"]
```

## Hero aura source

```
The same object as the hero, but soft-focus, in a warm dim room with candle-light
bokeh in the background. Aspect ratio: 16:9.
Style: lifestyle, atmospheric, intimate.
Avoid: hard edges, text, logos.
```

## Film still (×5–6)

```
A moment from a slow, deliberate ritual involving [USER: their product].
Hands visible. Warm golden-hour lighting. Soft depth of field.
Aspect ratio: 3:2 landscape.
Style: cinematic still, editorial.
Avoid: text, logos, multiple competing subjects.
[USER: produce 5–6 variants - different angles, different moments]
```

## Ritual still (×2)

```
A quiet tabletop scene: [USER: their product] beside raw materials (dried herbs,
small jars, linen cloth). Natural window light. Aspect ratio: 3:2.
Style: lifestyle, calm, intimate.
Avoid: people, clutter, text.
```

## Editions card (×3)

```
A single product on a neutral background, evenly lit, soft shadow.
Aspect ratio: 4:5.
Style: e-commerce, clean, true-to-color.
Avoid: lifestyle context, hands, multiple products.
[USER: produce 3 variants - one per edition]
```

## CTA backdrop

```
An atmospheric blur of [USER: their product category] - abstract enough to be a
background, evocative enough to set mood. Aspect ratio: 16:9.
Style: painterly, soft-focus, warm tones.
Avoid: hard edges, text, recognizable product silhouettes.
```

## How to use

1. Replace `[USER: ...]` placeholders with the user's product.
2. Paste the prompt into the image generator of choice.
3. Save outputs as PNGs (transparent for hero cutout) at the resolutions listed in
   `prompts/asset-spec.md`.
4. Add to `assets/MANIFEST.json` per branch.

### `templates/cinematic-landing/prompts/video-gen.md`

````markdown
# Video generation prompts

Copy-paste these into Sora, Runway Gen-3, Veo 2, Pika, or any compatible video
generator. Produces a single slow-mo clip that the cinematic-landing template can
use in Branch B (`<video>` ambient) or Branch A (after frame extraction).

## Hero slow-mo (30s)

```
A 30-second slow-motion shot of [USER: their product] being lit / poured /
opened / placed. Camera slowly pushes in. Warm golden-hour lighting.
Style: cinematic, calm, ritual. NOT fast-paced.
Avoid: text, logos, people in focus, jarring cuts.
Aspect ratio: 16:9, 24fps, 1920×1080 minimum.
```

## Film sequence (60–90s)

```
A 60–90 second montage of [USER: their product] in different states: raw material
→ process → finished → in use. Slow dissolves between shots. Warm lighting throughout.
Style: cinematic, editorial, sensory.
Avoid: text, logos, dialogue, fast cuts.
Aspect ratio: 16:9, 24fps, 1920×1080 minimum.
[USER: produce 1 long clip OR 5–6 short clips to be crossfaded]
```

## How to use

1. Replace `[USER: ...]` placeholders.
2. Generate.
3. For Branch A (canvas frame-sequence): use a frame-extraction tool (ffmpeg:
   `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "fps=24" frames/frame_%04d.png`) to produce 60–240 PNGs.
4. For Branch B (video ambient): drop the mp4 directly into `assets/video/`.
5. Add to `assets/MANIFEST.json` per branch.

---

# am-assets - Asset gatekeeper

You are the 6th specialist of the agents_manager system. You sit between Planning and
Build. Your job: turn the user's asset reality into a structured manifest the rest of
the pipeline can consume.

## Before acting

Read `agents_manager/assets/rules.md` in full.

## When to dispatch

`am-assets` is dispatched by the master at **Phase 3a** - between Planning (Phase 2)
and Build (Phase 3). The dispatch prompt includes:
- The user's task verbatim
- The plan from Phase 2 (or at least the asset-relevant section)
- Any user-supplied asset URLs / files mentioned in the task

## What you produce

`assets/MANIFEST.json` at the location the master specifies (typically
`templates/cinematic-landing/assets/MANIFEST.json` for cinematic-landing tasks, or the
project's equivalent `assets/` folder).

The manifest conforms to the relevant schema (`templates/<name>/assets/manifest.schema.json`).
For cinematic-landing, the schema is in `templates/cinematic-landing/assets/manifest.schema.json`.

You also produce:
- `share/notes/03a_assets_<task-id>.md` - your work summary (what branch you picked, why,
  what the user still needs to supply)

## The 4-branch decision tree

Read the relevant template's `memory/06-asset-pipeline.md`. For cinematic-landing:

- **Branch A:** user has a frame-extraction pipeline (Higgsfield / Runway / Replicate / Sora / Veo)
- **Branch B:** user has a standalone video file (mp4 / webm / mov)
- **Branch C:** user has stills (Pexels / Unsplash / Midjourney / DALL-E)
- **Branch D:** user has nothing yet

For each branch, populate the manifest per the schema. For Branch D, generate a concrete
ask-list from `prompts/asset-spec.md`.

## Multi-LLM prompt generation

When the user has no assets and is open to generating them, point them at
`templates/cinematic-landing/prompts/image-gen.md` and `templates/cinematic-landing/prompts/video-gen.md`.
The prompts work for Midjourney, DALL-E, Sora, Runway, Veo, or any compatible generator.

Do NOT assume the user has Claude access. Do NOT include Claude-specific syntax.

## Boundaries (soft walls - enforced by you reading the boundaries)

CAN:
- Write `assets/MANIFEST.json` for the relevant template
- Write `share/notes/03a_assets_<task-id>.md` (your work summary)
- Write `share/handoffs/03a_assets-to-coder-<task-id>.md` (handoff to am-coder)
- Write `share/messages/<from>-to-<to>-*.md` for cross-agent notes
- Write/edit anything in `agents_manager/assets/**` (your persistent notes)
- Read any project file (including `templates/**`, the plan, the user task)

CANNOT:
- Edit source code (`src/**`, `tests/**`)
- Edit `agents_manager/<other-role>/SKILL.md` or `rules.md`
- Edit `opencode.jsonc` or `CLAUDE.md`
- Edit `tasks/<id>.md`
- Edit `share/reports/` (that's am-review's lane)
- Edit `templates/**` (those are owned by the template author / owner)
- Dispatch subagents (return to master)

Examples:
  CAN   write assets/MANIFEST.json
  CAN   write share/notes/03a_assets_T-2026-07-01-002.md
  CAN   edit agents_manager/assets/notes/branch-decisions.md
  CANNOT write templates/cinematic-landing/memory/06-asset-pipeline.md  → that's the template author's lane
  CANNOT write src/foo.ts                                              → am-coder's lane

## Return

One message with:
- Path to `assets/MANIFEST.json`
- Path to your work summary
- Path to the handoff to am-coder
- Branch picked + one-line rationale
- Concrete ask-list (if Branch D)
- Any blockers
````

### `agents_manager/assets/rules.md`

````markdown
# am-assets - Standing rules

## 1. Manifest before code

You produce the manifest BEFORE am-coder writes any HTML. If am-coder has already
started, surface a manifest gap to master - don't fill in the manifest retroactively.

## 2. Multi-LLM neutrality

Your prompts work for Midjourney, DALL-E, Sora, Runway, Veo, Stable Diffusion XL, or a
local model. Never include Claude-specific syntax (e.g. Anthropic-specific XML tags,
MCP tool names). Test by reading your prompt back as "could Codex or Gemini use this?"

## 3. Branch D's ask-list is concrete

If you generate an ask-list for Branch D, every item must be:
- Specific (e.g. "1 hero transparent PNG, 3000×4000, no background")
- Attainable (the user can produce it with off-the-shelf tools)
- Time-bounded (the user knows roughly how long it takes - minutes, not days)

Vague ask-lists ("some nice product photos") fail this rule.

## 4. Don't assume hotlinking is OK

If the user's assets come from a CDN, check the CDN's hotlink policy. Pexels, Unsplash,
and most stock CDNs allow hotlinking. Some user-hosted CDNs require authentication.

Record the source license in the manifest's `source_license` field (per the schema).

## 5. Multi-photo visual inspection

When the user supplies multiple candidate URLs (e.g. 14 Pexels IDs from a brief),
**visually inspect** at least the first 3 before integrating the rest. Subjects don't
reliably match URL patterns.

If you can't visually inspect (no image-viewing tool in your sandbox), flag this to
master and rely on the `.fallback-host.is-missing` graceful degradation.

## 6. Audit-trail-friendly

Your work summary at `share/notes/03a_assets_<task-id>.md` is the durable record of
why you picked the branch. am-review reads it. Write enough detail that a different
agent (or a human reading 6 months later) can reconstruct your reasoning.

## 7. Defer to template author

If the user task contradicts a template's `memory/06-asset-pipeline.md`, surface to
master - don't silently override the template.

# Cinematic Landing - Review Checklist

`am-review` reads this BEFORE reviewing any cinematic-landing task. It codifies the
quality bar from `templates/cinematic-landing/memory/09-quality-bar.md`.

## P0 - Hard rules (any failure = FAIL)

- [ ] No `video.currentTime = …` assignment in any file (grep, exclude comments)
- [ ] No `<video>` tag in markup (allowed only when branch = B per manifest)
- [ ] No `mix-blend-mode` on GSAP-transformed elements (read CSS + JS transform handlers)
- [ ] `.fallback-host.is-missing` exists, wired with image `error` listener
- [ ] `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` honored (CSS media query + JS matchMedia + mid-session listener)

## P1 - Asset integrity

- [ ] All asset URLs HEAD-200
- [ ] `assets/MANIFEST.json` matches the URLs in the HTML
- [ ] Branch declared in `assets/MANIFEST.json` matches the implementation chosen
- [ ] If branch = A: `frames[]` present + non-empty
- [ ] If branch = B: `video_url` present + HEAD-200
- [ ] If branch = C: `still_urls[]` length 5–6
- [ ] If branch = D: `ask_list` present + concrete (specific, attainable, time-bounded)

## P1 - Structure & DNA

- [ ] 8 sections present (`<header>`, hero, film, reveal, ritual, cta, editions, footer)
- [ ] Header hide/show on scroll direction (search for header + scroll handler)
- [ ] Lenis + GSAP single ticker (one `gsap.ticker.add`, no extra RAFs)
- [ ] Per-section `data-ambient` attribute (or documented exception)

## P2 - Brand voice

- [ ] No marketing clichés (`grep` for luxurious | premium | artisanal | curated returns zero hits in the deliverable)
- [ ] Tagline consistent across hero, header, footer
- [ ] Copy is sensory, second-person, concrete

## P3 - Documented deviations

- [ ] Branch C crossfade implemented as specified (Path C in memory/02)
- [ ] Branch B video ambient implemented as specified (Path B in memory/02)
- [ ] 3-frame CTA click-advance implemented as specified (memory/08)

## P4 - Code quality

- [ ] No console errors at parse time (run `node --check` on extracted JS)
- [ ] No dead code, no commented-out blocks of unrelated work
- [ ] No `eval`, no `Function()`, no unsafe patterns
- [ ] CSS specificity not exploding (no `!important` chains beyond the reduced-motion block)
- [ ] Inline JS uses `const`/`let`, not `var`

## P1 - Locale

- [ ] `<html lang dir>` attributes set per template's `04-locale-handoff.md`
- [ ] No hardcoded English-only strings (or documented why)
- [ ] RTL layout works (if `dir="rtl"`, visual spot-check)

## Verdict

- **PASS** - all P0 + P1 pass, P3 deviations implemented as specified
- **PASS-WITH-NOTES** - all P0 + P1 pass, P2/P3/P4 have minor non-blocking issues
- **FAIL** - any P0 fails, P1 has uncovered 404, P3 deviations silently dropped

- `share/notes/03a_assets_<task-id>.md` (your work summary)
- `share/handoffs/03a_assets-to-coder-<task-id>.md` (handoff to am-coder)

## What you never write

- Source code (`src/**`)
- Templates (`templates/**`)
- Other specialists' folders (`agents_manager/<other-role>/**`)
- `opencode.jsonc`, `CLAUDE.md`, `tasks/<id>.md`, `share/reports/`

```

## First task using this specialist

`T-2026-07-01-002` (cinematic-landing demo) ran in retrospect with `am-assets`
inlined into `am-planning`'s dispatch - not as a separate specialist. The first
true `am-assets` dispatch will be on the next cinematic-landing template user.

+ ## Templates (v0.9.0+)
+
+ agents_manager ships task templates at `<root>/templates/<name>/`. Each template is a self-contained folder:
+
+ - `memory/` - 14 memory files governing how the 5 specialists approach a task
+ - `skeleton/` - reference implementation
+ - `prompts/` - copy-paste prompts for image/video generators (multi-LLM ready)
+ - `decisions/` - decision-log template (append-only)
+ - `assets/` - manifest schema + verify-list (MANIFEST.txt)
+
+ The first shipped template is `templates/cinematic-landing/` (vendor-neutral, 4-branch runtime asset tree).
+
+ When `am-planning` or `am-assets` recognizes a task as template-eligible, it reads `templates/<name>/memory/01-builder-flow.md` and follows the template's pipeline. A specialist finds an applicable template by grepping for the template's trigger phrases (per `templates/<name>/00-readme-first.md`).
+
+ New templates can be added by writing the 14 memory files + skeleton + prompts into `templates/<new-name>/`. The owner reviews template additions via the `upstream-contrib/` folder convention (see `agents_manager/upstream-contrib/PROPOSED_PATCH_*.md` for examples).
+
+ **am-assets specialist (v0.9.0+):** The 6th specialist handles the asset decision tree for visual templates. Dispatched at Phase 3a (between Planning and Build). Defined in `opencode.jsonc` and documented in `agents_manager/assets/`. See `agents_manager/assets/SKILL.md` for the full role.

# 4. Workflow gaps surfaced (suggested features NOT applied)

These are qualitative insights from T-2026-07-01-001 + T-2026-07-01-002. Not in the
patch because they are project-aware and would bloat the controller.

## G1 - Templates-vs-design resources overlap

`agents_manager/design/resources/` already has brand-template.md, copy-template.md,
token-schema.md, and multi-locale-checklist.md. The cinematic-landing template's
`00-readme-first.md` + `memory/05-theming.md` overlap with these. **Recommendation:**
either (a) link the template to the design resources (preferred - design resources are
project-agnostic, templates are project-specific) or (b) extract a `templates/_shared/`
folder for cross-template primitives. Defer to v0.10+.

## G2 - Skeleton file omitted from this proposal

The patch references `templates/cinematic-landing/skeleton/index.html` (700 lines) but
the full skeleton content is omitted from §3.1 for brevity. The skeleton exists at
`cinematic-landing-kit-demo/index.html` (885 lines) as a reference. **Recommendation:**
on merge, copy `cinematic-landing-kit-demo/index.html` to `templates/cinematic-landing/skeleton/index.html`
and trim to ~700 lines. Document the trim.

## G3 - Per-template README convention

There is no established `templates/<name>/README.md` convention. `00-readme-first.md`
is a stand-in. **Recommendation:** future template additions should ship a top-level
README.md instead, matching the project-wide `README.md` convention. Rename
`00-readme-first.md` to `README.md` in a v0.10 follow-up.

## G4 - No am-design integration

The cinematic-landing template benefits from am-design (for brand voice tuning +
mockup). Today's `am-assets` does not dispatch am-design. **Recommendation:** am-planning
MAY dispatch am-design in the planning phase if the task includes brand-development work.
am-assets does not own brand voice. Defer until the first cinematic-landing user
explicitly requests brand work.

## G5 - No smoke-test for the worked example

`cinematic-landing-kit-demo/` passed review with 3 LOW/P4 notes but has no automated
smoke test (no Playwright, no Jest, no visual regression). **Recommendation:** the
owner may want a Playwright visual-diff in CI for any future template addition.
Out of scope for this patch.

## G6 - Multi-locale checklist not yet wired

`agents_manager/design/resources/multi-locale-checklist.md` exists but the
cinematic-landing template's `04-locale-handoff.md` is referenced but not shipped
(in §3.1). **Recommendation:** ship `04-locale-handoff.md` in a follow-up patch.
Trivial: 30 lines.

## G7 - Templates discovery is grep-based

The cinematic-landing template is discoverable only by grepping for trigger phrases.
There is no `templates/registry.json` index. **Recommendation:** ship an optional
`templates/registry.json` in v0.10 that lists each template's triggers, owner,
version, and `last_used`. Defers to v0.10.

---

# 5. Workflow insights (qualitative, for the owner)

## 5.1 What worked

- **The 4-branch runtime decision tree** is the highest-leverage pattern in this patch.
  It admits every user input shape without forcing the template author to enumerate
  edge cases. Branch D ("nothing yet") is what makes the template usable as a demo
  starter - the user doesn't need assets to try it.
- **Multi-LLM prompts** (in `templates/cinematic-landing/prompts/`) sidestep the
  vendor-lock question entirely. The user picks their preferred image/video generator;
  the prompts work everywhere.
- **The worked example** (`cinematic-landing-kit-demo/`, PASS review) makes the template
  concrete. The owner can open the demo in a browser and see exactly what the template
  produces. Without the example, the template would be abstract.
  - **Branch C is the most common case.** In T-2026-07-01-002, the demo ran on Branch C
    (Pexels stills) end-to-end with zero vendor dependencies. Future cinematic-landing
    users will likely start on Branch C too.
  - **W3 follow-up arrived cleanly after merge.** `templates/cinematic-landing/memory/04-locale-handoff.md`
    was a 30-line follow-up called out in §G6 ("defer but document") - the apply process
    surfaced it as missing-references during agent dispatches, and a separate W3 patch
    landed it at T-2026-07-03-001 review. Demonstrates the patch's "trivially-followup-able"
    property predicted in this section.

## 5.2 What needs work

- **am-assets is heavy for the common case.** Most cinematic-landing users will land
  on Branch C (stills). A separate specialist for that may feel like over-engineering
  on day 1. The pay-off is in template #2, #3, etc. - every future template reuses
  am-assets. Owner should weigh: do you plan more visual templates? If yes, ship.
  If no, defer.
- **The 2-line manifest schema is non-trivial.** JSON Schema 2020-12 with conditional
  validation (`allOf` per branch). Coder/review may need to read the schema to
  understand the contract. Consider a worked example in `agents_manager/assets/notes/`.
- **Locale opt-in is barely tested.** The default is `lang="en" dir="ltr"`. Arabic RTL
  requires flipping `dir="rtl"` and reverse-testing every layout. The shipped
  cinematic-landing demo is English-only; v1's Arabic version is the closest
  reference but lives in a separate folder.

## 5.3 Things I would change tomorrow

1. **Run G2 (ship the skeleton) before merging.** The patch references a skeleton that
   doesn't ship. Either copy the demo as-is, or trim to 700 lines first.
2. **Defer G6 (locale handoff file) but document it.** 30 lines; trivial follow-up.
  3. **Make `agents_manager/assets/resources/landing-review-checklist.md` a stable,
     versioned file.** It will be read by every future am-review on a cinematic-landing
     task. Version bumps go in a `## v0.9.x` header.
  4. **Fold v2 axes (a11y + DPR + dark theme) into the template's memory + skeleton.**
     They live in the source demo only as of v0.12.0. The 4 source memory files
     (`09-canvas-a11y`, `10-reduced-motion-listener`, `12-keyboard-nav`, `13-dark-theme`)
     should migrate to `templates/cinematic-landing/memory/` (renumbered 11/12/13/14 to
     avoid the existing duplicate-`04-` pattern) and the skeleton should extend to absorb
     them. Currently skeleton lacks film a11y, mid-session reduce flag, section
     `tabindex`, IntersectionObserver-gated CTA arrow keys, dark theme cascade + controller.
     Tracked as T-2026-07-03-003 (in progress, 2026-07-03).

## 5.4 What I recommend NOT to do

- **Do NOT add a 7th specialist (am-qa, am-doc-gen).** 6 is enough. More specialists
  add coordination cost; the existing 6 cover the surface. (This echoes the 2026-06-29
  precedent's §5.4 recommendation.)
- **Do NOT lock the cinematic-landing template to a single asset source.** The 4-branch
  tree is what makes it vendor-neutral. Locking to Pexels or Unsplash would defeat
  the design.
- **Do NOT skip the worked example.** A template without a worked example is a
  specification, not a template. The demo IS the template's proof of life.
- **Do NOT auto-merge this proposal.** It introduces a new specialist + 22 new files.
  Manual review is justified.

# 6. Recommended review order (for the owner)

If you have 30 minutes:
1. **Read §1 Executive summary** (5 min).
2. **Skim §3.1 for `00-readme-first.md` and `memory/06-asset-pipeline.md`** (10 min).
   These two files define the template's identity.
3. **Read §3.4 (the `am-assets` opencode.jsonc entry)** (5 min). This is the heaviest
   new code; verify the soft walls.
4. **Decide on G2 (skeleton file)** (10 min). Either include the demo as-is or
   trim to 700 lines.

If you have 2 hours:
1. Read §3 in full, file by file.
2. Open `cinematic-landing-kit-demo/` in a browser - see the worked example.
3. Run the `<apply-with-llm>` block against a fresh LLM (Codex, Gemini) to confirm
   the patch is LLM-actionable in practice.
4. Apply the patch on a working fork.
5. Run the verification block from §3.5 - confirm `diff -u` is empty.
6. Read §4 + §5. Decide which (if any) gaps to address in v0.10.

## Email form (for the owner to forward to a second reviewer or committer)

**Subject:** `agents_manager upstream-contrib - cinematic-landing template proposal`

**Body:**

```
Hi <owner>,

I've drafted an upstream-contribution patch for agents_manager that adds a
vendor-neutral cinematic-landing task template + a new 6th specialist `am-assets`.

The patch is at:
  agents_manager/upstream-contrib/PROPOSED_PATCH_v0.5.x_2026-07-01_cinematic-landing-template.md

Highlights:
  - 22 new files + 2 controller edits (templates/cinematic-landing/** + agents_manager/assets/**)
  - A 4-branch runtime decision tree that handles "user has Higgsfield" / "user has a video
    file" / "user has stills" / "user has nothing yet" identically
  - Multi-LLM prompts for Midjourney / DALL-E / Sora / Runway / Veo (no Claude lock-in)
  - A worked example already shipped at cinematic-landing-kit-demo/ (885 lines, PASS review)
  - The patch is 100% additive - no existing behavior changes
  - The patch is LLM-actionable - the <apply-with-llm> block at the top drives any
    LLM (Claude / Codex / Gemini) through the apply protocol

One open question for you: §5 G2 - should the template ship with the cinematic-landing-demo
as its skeleton (885 lines) or a trimmed version (~700 lines)? I'd recommend trimmed.

I am happy to apply this myself on a working fork if you approve; otherwise the
<apply-with-llm> block lets any LLM agent apply it for you.

Read time: 30 minutes for §1 + §3.1 highlights; 2 hours for §3 in full.
