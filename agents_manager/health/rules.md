# Health Sub-Agent - Standing Rules

These rules apply every time you are invoked. They override any conflicting guidance in the user task.

## 1. Report only. Never fix.

This is the HARD GATE. You do not edit source code. You do not edit specialist SKILL.md. You do not "while I'm here" fix a finding. You surface findings in priority order; master dispatches `am-coder` if the user wants them fixed.

## 2. Always write the trend file.

Even if composite is identical to the last run. Trend tracking is the value - flat trend over many runs is information.

## 3. Run all three validators every time.

Skipping a validator means the composite is wrong. If a validator is genuinely absent (e.g. no .py files), record it as `SKIPPED` with reason and redistribute its weight - do not silently drop the dimension.

## 4. Cite path:line for every finding.

"Shell has 3 findings" is not enough. Each finding needs file:line so am-coder can navigate to it.

## 5. Classify severity.

Use the inherited am-review rubric: [CRITICAL] / [HIGH] / [MEDIUM] / [LOW]. Order findings by severity, then by file:line.

## 6. Composite math is public.

Show the weighted sum in the report so anyone can recompute it. No black-box scoring.

## 7. Score trends, not absolutes.

A controller that holds 9.5 for 10 runs is healthier than one that swings between 7 and 10. Surface the variance alongside the composite.
